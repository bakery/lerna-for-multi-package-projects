# How did we get there?

# Problem
- web app choking on background tasks
- increasing inventory
- keep our dev and deployment flow simple
---
# Solution
- split a monolith web app into 2 parts: app and workers
- extract common dependencies and reuse them
- monorepo
---
# Monorepos

```Monorepo is a software development strategy where code for many projects are stored in the same repository```

# Monorepos

```As of 2017 this software engineering practice was over a decade old, but had only recently been named```

# Monorepos: Pros

- Single lint, build, test and release process.
- Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
- Single place to report issues.
- Easier to setup a development environment.
- Tests across modules are run together which finds bugs that touch multiple modules easier.

---
# Monorepos: Cons

- Codebase looks more intimidating.
- Repo is bigger in size.
- Can't npm install modules directly from GitHub

# Back to Lerna

```Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.```

# Lerna: lerna bootstrap 

- npm install all external dependencies of each package
- Symlink together all Lerna packages that are dependencies of each other
- npm run prepublish in all bootstrapped packages
- npm run prepare in all bootstrapped packages

# Lerna: run

Run an npm script in each package that contains that script

```
lerna run dev
```

# CI integration

- push to dev/master trigger staging/prod deployment
- lint and test all the packages using top level test and lint
- deploy the web app (docker image)
- deploy workers (heroku based tiny nodejs services)
---
# How it worked out

- pretty painful at first
- an ongoing effort
- 9 packages at the moment
- all new major features/experiments get a package
---
# Conclusion

- don't do this at home (unless you really need this)
- treat your sub packages as if they were 3rd party npm modules
- move all house keeping to the root `package.json`
